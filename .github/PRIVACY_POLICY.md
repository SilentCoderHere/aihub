This app is maintained by an individual developer (Silent Coder), with help from the community. It is not owned or operated by a company.

## Data Collection
This app does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

We do NOT collect:
- Personal information
- Usage data

- Account information

## External Websites
This app opens external AI websites using a WebView.

It also connects to GitHub Pages to load AI service information and required connection lists.

These external websites are not controlled by the app developer. They may collect data under their own privacy policies. Only the connections needed for the app to work are allowed, but it is not possible to fully block all third-party tracking.

Please review the privacy policies of those websites before using them.

## Data Sharing
No user data is sold or shared because no user data is collected.
